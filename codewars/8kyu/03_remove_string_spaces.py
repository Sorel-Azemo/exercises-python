Problem:
Write a function that removes the spaces from the string, then return the resultant string.

Example:
    "8aaaaa dddd r     " -> "8aaaaaddddr"

What I learned:
- append() is a list method, not a string method.
- The replace() method can be used to replace spaces
  with an empty string.

Alternative solution:
Using replace() is a simpler and more concise approach.
